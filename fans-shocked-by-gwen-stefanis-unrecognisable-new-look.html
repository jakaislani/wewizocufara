Can't believe how different she looks now," said another, referring to one of her No Doubt looks of the late 90s.</p><p>"I'm a lifelong fan of Gwen's and I didn't recognise her.

In a 2016 Carpool Karaoke appearance, host James Corden asked her about how exactly she seemed to be ageing in reverse – and she attributed it to her relationship with now-husband Blake Shelton.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/LgCHoA8JvU9e_FbqO4UEi0hFKAI=/16x23/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/P35MMBABM7FQ7G7FNRXATYBRDQ.png"><p>"I kind of started falling in love. Then I wrote a whole record about that. That's what the 'face' lift is, I think!" she said.</p><p>It's not the first time the chameleonic Stefani's made headlines for a near-unrecognisable new look. Back in 2016, she shocked fans by appearing at the Billboard Awards with vastly different make-up - enough of a major departure for her that her longtime make-up artist later had to publicly defend the new look.</p><p>And last year, the star caused a stir with a wild new hairdo as she fronted up to an episode of The Voice: her usual blonde hair, plus black bangs and a black ponytail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/0lIBBJC1ym_vGkprd2SP54YO1R8=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/PBJAVHAMRJ26KQQYS7UVMPKM7E.png"><p>Stefani evolved into a style icon after her early days as the frontwoman of 90s ska-pop band No Doubt, going solo in 2004 and eventually launching her own fashion and make-up lines.</p><p>But fans eager to hear more music from the star, who hasn't released an album in five years, will be disappointed by her candid confession in a recent interview.</p><p>Revealing she wrote "30+ songs" for a new album during Covid quarantine, Stefani confessed she didn't feel passionate about any of the material, and instead decided to focus her energies on her marriage to Shetlon.</p><p>"I kind of put it on the back-burner, but I also feel like sometimes, I don't really have much to say or I don't know if I do – and so, I'm just going to wait and pray about it," she told Forbes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSzorrSZqqhp5OgsqV5wbJkoK%2BVo3q0wMSfmKeho2LCr77EnKagppmorqO4xGalnq9dobywt46Kf4tqfXyPhpWjiY%2BHboh3nniSs4xriHlkenw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
