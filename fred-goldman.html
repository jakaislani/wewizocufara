He remarried in 1987 and moved to Southern California with Kim and new wife Patti’s three children.

Ron had gone there to return a pair of eyeglasses left behind at the Mezzaluna restaurant, where he worked as a waiter. Fred and his family learned about Ron’s death the next day and were devastated by the news.</p><img alt="kim goldman, fred goldman, and patti goldman stand together outside a building, fred speaks into a microphone on a stand" title="Kim Goldman, Fred Goldman, and Patti Goldman at a press conference in August 1995" width=1469 height=983 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fred-goldman-father-of-the-murdered-ronald-goldman-along-news-photo-1712940059.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Fred Goldman regularly spoke to the media during O.J.

I and my family will do everything in our power to bring about the kind of change that won’t allow what happened today to ever happen to another family again.”<br></p><h2 data-node-id=19 title="Fight for Justice" data-anchor-id=fight-for-justice class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Fight for Justice</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the trial, Goldman dedicated himself to improving the criminal justice system by becoming a director with the nonprofit Safe Streets. In February 1997, the Goldmans won their civil suit against Simpson. They were awarded $8.5 million in compensatory damages, with another $25 million to be split between them and Brown Simpson’s family, but they had a hard time collecting the money. They were able to seize Simpson’s Heisman Trophy and sold it for roughly $250,000 in 1999.</p><img alt="kim goldman, fred goldman, and patti goldman stand together, fred holds a book in front of him as all three people look to the right" title="Kim Goldman, Fred Goldman, and Patti Goldman at a book release event in February 1997" width=2383 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kim-goldman-fred-goldman-and-patti-goldman-attend-the-book-news-photo-1712939758.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Kim, Fred, and Patti Goldman released a book, titled His Name Is Ron, about their brother and son in 1997.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Goldman family also shared their loss and personal struggles in the 1997 book His Name Is Ron: Our Search for Justice. Although the family received a $450,000 advance for their story, Fred insisted they weren’t doing it for the money. “Doing this book will give us the vehicle to spend more time pressing for judicial reform in this country and to speak out on behalf of all victims’ rights,” he told Publishers Weekly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around 1999, Goldman was named the president of GlobalTrak International. He later worked in real estate and in retail sales after relocating to Arizona.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Goldman has never given up trying to hold Simpson accountable for the death of his son. He and his family sued Simpson over his plans to publish a hypothetical account of the murders called If I Did It in 2007. The Goldmans eventually won the rights to the work and published it as <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/If-I-Did-Confessions-Killer-ebook/dp/B08N446VNY data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer" data-vars-ga-product-id=99f555c3-4b66-48de-bfad-60a6c2f0ca26 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/If-I-Did-Confessions-Killer-ebook/dp/B08N446VNY data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/If-I-Did-Confessions-Killer-ebook/dp/B08N446VNY data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/If-I-Did-Confessions-Killer-ebook/dp/B08N446VNY data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=71b007b6-cc3b-432b-bf6f-fdffb81a73ef class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to The Guardian, Fred felt like releasing the book was a way “to show anybody who’s sitting on the fence about this case that [Simpson] was responsible for the murder of Ron and Nicole.” The following year, he was in a Nevada courtroom when Simpson was convicted for armed robbery and kidnapping, after attacking two sports memorabilia dealers. The fallen football legend maintained he had been trying to retrieve his personal items. “If our efforts for all these years of pushing him drove him to commit armed robbery in Vegas, great!” Fred told reporters afterward. “This monster is where he belongs—behind bars.”</p><h2 data-node-id=26 title="Recent Years" data-anchor-id=recent-years class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Recent Years</h2><img alt="kim gold and fred goldman sit in chairs and look at a reporter during an interview" title="Kim Goldman and Fred Goldman on the 'Today' show in September 2017" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pictured-kim-goldman-fred-goldman-and-megyn-kelly-on-friday-news-photo-1712936165.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Kim and Fred Goldman in September 2017</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2014, on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the murders, Goldman revealed in an interview with the Daily Mail his belief that Simpson lawyer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/legal-figures/robert-kardashian data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Kardashian" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Kardashian</a> had taken crucial evidence from the ex-football star’s home and hidden it. “That evidence would have convicted the killer,” Goldman said.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Keep Reading</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Later that year, it was announced that production would begin on an anthology series called American Crime Story, with the saga of the Simpson murders and trial set to be featured in the first season.
