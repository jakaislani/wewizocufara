When asked about returning to the ring at IMPACT 1000, Kim admitted teaming with Trinity gives her goosebumps, and she couldn’t have asked for a better match.</p><p>“Tagging with Trinity, that gives me goosebumps,” Gail Kim said. “This is a dream match, and there are still surprises to come. I couldn’t have asked for a better match. It’s a great reason to wrestle again.</p><p>“I didn’t even expect myself to be back, but it’s a special occasion. I found out about a month ago, and I get to work with amazing people. It’s going to be a celebration, a reunion, and some nostalgia that wrestling fans will love.”</p><p>One of Gail Kim’s tag team partners is Awesome Kong, one of Kim’s greatest rivals. Kim spoke about recently meeting up with her at ODB’s wedding.</p><p>“I saw Kong not too long ago at ODB’s wedding, and she looked great,” Gail Kim said. “She said she was ready to scratch that itch and get back in the ring. And here we are; my greatest rival is about to become my greatest partner.</p><p>“When I came out of retirement for a singles match in 2019, I took it very seriously. I was a perfectionist. At 46, the training is more of a challenge–but it’s a challenge that I welcome. A close friend of mine and my husband both told to me accept that I’m 46 and I can’t do the same things I did. And I thought about it and said, ‘Screw that.’ I’m going to do the best I can, and I hope the fans love it.”</p><h2 id=h-gail-kim-will-be-part-of-a-big-tag-team-match-at-impact-1000>Gail Kim will be part of a big tag team match at IMPACT 1000</h2><p>Gail Kim went on to trumpet IMPACT Wrestling as the place for women’s wrestling and believes the company continues to move that division forward.</p><p>“To this day, I feel we are the place to be for female wrestling,” Gail Kim said. “We have such a great locker and great people here. I cry tears of joy knowing that the women keep moving Impact forward, and that Impact keeps showcasing the women.</p><p>“[Impact Wrestling President] Scott D’Amore has always been very supportive of women in wrestling, and&nbsp;Emergence&nbsp;was a great example. We had Deonna Purrazzo and Trinity in the ring for the main event, a woman referee and a woman ring announcer, and me on commentary–and Scott D’Amore made that happen. The women keep working harder, and that never ends.”</p><p><a href=#>SANADA Names Gail Kim As The Best Female Wrestler He’s Ever Seen</a></p><p>What do you make of Gail Kim’s comments?
