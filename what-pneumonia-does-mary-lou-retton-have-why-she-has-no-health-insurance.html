Fondly remembered as a dynamic teenage Olympian, Retton is now a dedicated mother of four daughters.</p><p>While the specific details of Retton’s illness remain undisclosed, pneumonia, a common ailment, can, at times, take a severe turn, necessitating hospitalization.</p><h2>Why she has no Health Insurance?</h2><p>The news of Olympic gymnastics icon Mary Lou Retton’s life-threatening bout with pneumonia has stirred both concern and disbelief among her fans. As she fights for her life, a surprising revelation has come to light – she lacks health insurance, and her family has resorted to crowdfunding to cover her mounting hospital bills.</p><p>In a heartfelt plea for assistance, Retton’s daughter, McKenna Kelley, shared the dire nature of her mother’s situation. “My amazing mom, Mary Lou, has a very rare form of pneumonia and is fighting for her life. She is not able to breathe on her own. She’s been in the ICU for over a week now,” Kelley stated.</p><p>While the location of Retton’s treatment remains undisclosed, it is known that she currently resides in Houston, Texas. Kelley explained that the vagueness surrounding her mother’s treatment was to respect her privacy but acknowledged the absence of insurance.</p><p>“ANYTHING, absolutely anything, would be so helpful for my family and my mom. Thank y’all so very much!” concluded Kelley. The fundraising campaign on Spotfund initially aimed to raise $50,000 but has since surpassed triple that amount.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>More than 3,000 donors have donated $148,405 to a campaign started by Mary Lou Retton’s daughter McKenna Kelley to pay for bills associated with her care for a rare form of pneumonia.</p><p>Her daughter says the Olympic great does not have medical insurance.</p><p>— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) <a href=# rel=noopener>October 11, 2023</a></p><p>The precise reasons for Mary Lou’s lack of insurance are not entirely clear. Despite her continued work in endorsement deals, including those with drugstore chains, it appears she may not have health insurance through a single employer. It’s possible she neglected to purchase a plan herself on the open market.</p><p>This revelation has left many who adored Mary Lou during her competitive days outraged. One person aptly commented, “No human in America shouldn’t be without healthcare, famous or not. The supposedly richest country in the world, and many citizens are in her shoes every day. It’s inhumane.”</p><p>Thankfully, it appears that Mary Lou has garnered enough financial support to address her medical expenses. Nevertheless, her situation underscores the broader issue of healthcare accessibility that countless individuals face.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kxKmt02anp52loryvtcBmm6ido2K6or7YZqOorV2nsrXAzqdkoZmmmnq4tNhmqqGdXZ2utHnNqGShnZGhwal5yKeqrqqRo7Cmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
