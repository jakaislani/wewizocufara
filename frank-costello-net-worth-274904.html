He rose to the top of organized crime in America and controlled a gambling empire while having political influence. Costello was known as "The Prime Minister of the Underworld". He led the Luciano crime family which was later called the Genovese crime family. The Lucianos were one of the Five Families who operated in New York City. He was introduced to gang activities at a young age after boarding a ship to the United States in 1895. He worked for the Morello gang and met Charlie "Lucky" Luciano and hit it off as friends and partners. In 1961 the United States Supreme Court upheld a decision that stripped him of his U.S. citizenship but set aside a deportation order. Frank Costello passed away on February 18, 1973 at 82 years old of a heart attack.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeWp66vt4ycpqyslaG5sHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5kXBrcmhk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
