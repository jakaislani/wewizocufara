They have tens of thousands of courses available on just about every subject. Whether you're looking for how to coordinate your closet after graduation or you want to learn how to edit videos on your laptop. They have a multitude of courses in just about every subject you could dream of.</p><p>I love that SkillShare doesn't rely on novice learners to power its base. Instead, it opts for multiple levels of courses on any given subject so that there's a real opportunity to grow and improve. Where Masterclass is built like a liberal arts education, SkillShare is a more specific trade school with tons of great info on each choice.</p><p>SkillShare has a few really fun capabilities that make it stand out from the crowd of online learning platforms. One of them is the ability to "schedule" learning for a specific time. I find that having a schedule for these things really increases my accountability and keeps me coming back to do what I commit to.</p><p>As someone who is profoundly Deaf, one of my favorite things about SkillShare is their transcript function. Each of their videos has a transcript available so that if you like to read while you listen, or, like me, sometimes you just want to not worry about keeping up with captions while trying to take notes, this is an impressive and helpful feature.</p><p>There's also a space on the platform to post questions to the teacher and interact with other students, share projects and concerns, and generally converse with one another.</p><p>Unfortunately, like Udemy, SkillShare has the issue of a lack of continuity of product quality from class to class. While most are fairly great, some of the classes would benefit from more editing or perhaps more time spent creating them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiZoqddl8K6v46gbWlwYWeDdn%2BOqKWloZ6aeq2xwKuloqaXYsGwu8us</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
