After the U.S. defense industry desegregated, Vaughan worked with leading computer operators and engineers, becoming an expert in the FORTRAN programming coding language at NASA. She worked on the SCOUT Launch Vehicle Program that shot satellites into space. Vaughan and other female African American mathematicians are the subject of a 2016 film Hidden Figures.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dorothy Johnson was born in Kansas City, Missouri on September 20, 1910. At age seven, her parents, Leonard and Anne Johnson, moved the family to Morgantown, West Virginia. She graduated from Beechurst High School in 1925, and four years later, received a Bachelor of Science degree from Wilberforce University in Ohio. In 1932, she married Howard Vaughan.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Career in Mathematics</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For the next eleven years, Vaughan divided her time between being a homemaker and a mathematics teacher at Robert Russa Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia. In 1943, the family moved to Newport News, Virginia, and Vaughan was employed as a mathematician at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (the predecessor agency to NASA) in what she thought would be a temporary job. A beneficiary of President <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/us-president/franklin-d-roosevelt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Franklin D. Roosevelt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>’s Executive Order 8802, Vaughan was among the first group of African Americans to be hired as mathematicians and scientists. The executive order prohibited discrimination based on race, religion and ethnicity in the defense industry.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Working Under Segregated Conditions</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, even with the executive order, state and local laws required "colored" mathematicians to work separately from their white female counterparts. Vaughan was assigned to the segregated “West Area Computing” unit, where she was required to use separate dining and restroom facilities. At NACA, she was responsible for calculating mathematical computations for engineers conducting aeronautical experiments in wind tunnels on the variables affecting drag and lift of aircraft.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1949, Vaughan became the first Black supervisor at NACA when she was promoted to manager of the West Area Computers. This workgroup was composed entirely of African American female mathematicians. The title gave her rare visibility and she collaborated with other well-known computer operators on various projects. She also became a dedicated advocate for female employees who deserved promotions or raises, often supporting white women as well.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Work with NASA and the Space Program</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Vaughan led the West Area Computing program for a decade. Then in 1958, as NACA was transitioning into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the agency abolished the segregated working environment. Vaughan joined the new Analysis and Computation Division, becoming an expert FORTRAN programmer, and worked on the SCOUT (Solid Controlled Orbital Utility Test) Launch Vehicle Program, one of the nation's most successful and reliable launch vehicles, used for launching a 385-pound satellite into a 500-mile orbit.</p><img alt="dorothy vaughan" title="Dorothy Vaughan" width=4900 height=3895 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dorothey-vaugh--female-nasa-employees-hired-to-perform-mathematics-calculations-and-known-as-human-computers-photo-via-smith-collectiongadogetty-images-.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Dorothy Johnson Vaughan (left)</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Vaughan sought but never received another management position at NASA. She retired in 1971. During the final decade of her career, Vaughan worked closely with fellow NASA mathematicians <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/scientist/katherine-g-johnson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Katherine G.

Vaughan died on November 10, 2008. Her legacy and the story of the other women of West Computing lives on in the 2016 film Hidden Figures.</p><ul data-node-id=20 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Dorothy Vaughan</li><li>Birth Year: 1910</li><li>Birth date: September 20, 1910</li><li>Birth State: Missouri</li><li>Birth City: Kansas City</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Dorothy Johnson Vaughan worked as a mathematician on the SCOUT Launch Vehicle Program that sent America’s first satellites into space.</li><li>Astrological Sign: Libra</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Wilberforce University</li></ul><li>Interesting Facts</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Dorothy Johnson Vaughan worked at NASA computing the flights of launch vehicles.</li></ul><li>Death Year: 2008</li><li>Death date: November 10, 2008</li><li>Death State: Virginia</li><li>Death City: Hampton</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/page/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Dorothy Johnson Vaughan Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/scientist/dorothy-johnson-vaughan</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&E Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: September 15, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: November 14, 2016</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiqnKGVo8Gqv9OsZp2noqTBqcWMo6ahpqOku27CwK6eoZme</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
