Apart from showing off the awesome CGI, this also allowed us to get a good look at the nasty triple scar the Mad Titan has running down the left side of his purple face.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>Naturally, the shape of the scar has reminded Marvel fans of another iconic character: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Wolverine</strong></a>. Wouldn’t it be fun to imagine that the Adamantium Avenger was the one responsible for giving Thanos his injuries?&nbsp;It sure would be, and already that’s what some people are hoping for on Twitter.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>In a perfect world, <a href=#>#wolverine</a> fought <a href=#>#thanos</a> and left him with a scar to be remembered. <a href=#>#AvengersInfinityWar</a> <a href=#>#SuperBowl</a> <a href=#>#Marvel</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AkiJeWowB1</a></p><p>— Pursue News (@PursueNews24) <a href=#>February 5, 2018</a></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>Some fans are willing to entertain the more likely option that Thanos’ facial disfigurement is probably due to Black Panther or maybe Captain America. But hey, it’s more fun to think that it’s Wolverine, right?</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/iGabrielleBC/status/960494266077274112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fcomicbook.com%2Fmarvel%2F2018%2F02%2F05%2Favengers-infinity-war-wolverine-thanos-x-men-%2F</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>Others even like to think of this as a kind of backdoor crossover between the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Fox’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Men</a> universe. Maybe Thanos has already visited that parallel world and fought Wolverine before coming to the MCU?</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thanos with claw mark scars lookin' like he just fought Wolverine to destroy the Fox cinematic universe and now's he's coming for the MCU. <a href=#>#InfinityWar</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QEEZAmbWut</a></p><p>— Andrew Ivimey (@Ivimey) <a href=#>February 5, 2018</a></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>The great thing is this idea isn’t as far-fetched as it was just a few months ago. Back in December, it was announced that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Disney had acquired 20th Century Fox</a>, thereby bringing the rights to the X-Men back to Marvel Studios. Given that, it’s expected that Wolverine and the rest of Xavier’s team will be integrated into the MCU at some point in Phase Four.</p><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=834 data-injectable=false>And, if they decide to take the route that the X-Men have always been there, just out of sight, then it’s potentially possible that Wolverine really is responsible for giving Thanos his scars. For example, Spider-Man didn’t return to Marvel until 2016, but it was retroactively agreed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the boy who Tony Stark saves in 2010’s&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Man 2</a>&nbsp;was Peter Parker. So basically, hold on to that fan theory, guys, as one day it might become canon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqikppq%2FqrrEZquhmZ6kwG6%2FwpqprGWRq7Kvs8Srqmahnpu2r7XTsmSwmaJk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
