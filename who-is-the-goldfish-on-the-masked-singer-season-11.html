Her dress is entirely made up of gills, while her skirt is made out of her fins. Two additional fins are also on her arms.” Needless to say, she is equally as stunning as she is talented…</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Given that her performance was posted to YouTube beforehand, fans of the franchise have already taken to TikTok to share their guesses as to who she could be, with @carpoolkyleoke — an expert Masked Singer and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Claim to Fame</a> decoder — getting a piece of all the action.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true><a title=@carpoolkyleoke href=#>@carpoolkyleoke</a><p>Do you know EXACTLY who this is?!

At a few points in the song, she has some breath control issues… But at the end, she’s just so dramatic and theatrical.”</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=171 data-injectable=false>Because of this, fans of the franchise took to the comment section to share their predictions, with the most common culprit being <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">High School Musical</a> star <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanessa Hudgens</a></strong>.</p><p>“It’s definitely Vanessa Hudgens”</p><p>“That line ‘Vampiiiire’ TOTALLY VANESSA HUDGENS”</p><p>“It’s Vanessa Hudgens. The fact that she sung Olivia Rodrigo and Olivia played her character in the reboot? It fits”</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>Other names that were proposed are Kristen Chenoweth, Trisha Paytas, Ashley Tisdale, and beyond, but we will just have to wait and see what the clues for The Goldfish will consist of on our television screens…</p><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>Be sure to tune into FOX tonight (March 6) at 8pm ET/PT for the premiere of The Masked Singer season 11, because it is sure to be a season to remember!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlpJ2ybrPOpZufoaOderC6jK2fnmWdlsCsscNmqqKml5q%2Fbr%2FEmqqopl1mfnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
