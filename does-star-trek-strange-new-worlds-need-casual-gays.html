From portraying one of the first onscreen interracial kisses (albeit under mind control), to the inclusion of characters across the gender spectrum, the franchise does try to project the image of a cosmopolitan cosmos — even if it’s occasionally thumbfingered in doing so (some of those TNG eps. Ouch!).</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>However, some fans are saying maybe the newer shows can concentrate less on “doing” and more on “being.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>i need star trek to have casual gays. let uhura say she has a gf back home. that person in pike’s bed should’ve been a man. not everything has to be one big reveal</p>— don (@MlNDMELD) <a href=#>May 12, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>Twitter user and Trek fan @MINDMELD recently posted that the franchise might better serve the needs of inclusion by being a little more offhanded about sexual orientation. While the relationship between &nbsp;Lt. Paul Stamets&nbsp;(Anthony Rapp) and&nbsp;Dr. Hugh Culber&nbsp;(Wilson Cruz) was something of a “TA-DAH!” moment on Star Trek: Discovery, @MINDMELD suggest a more “casual” approach might show a broader acceptance of sexuality in the 23rd century.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>“Let Uhura say she has a gf back home. that person in pike’s bed should’ve been a man. not everything has to be one big reveal,” he writes. User @roswordsman replied by noting that the Kelvin universe acknowledged a canonically gay Sulu subtly as opposed to any flourish, self-congratulatory or otherwise.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Low key liked that about beyond when they show sulu’s husband in a photo casually and then them together like a normal couple when they reunited and no big deal is made of it<br>More pls</p>— Ro -is in querying hell again- (@roswordsman) <a href=#>May 12, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>User @textwhileudrive noted that casual inclusion is often a more effective form of inclusion, noting the similarities between LGBTQ characters and disabled characters that often have their identity co-opted into forced narratives.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tbh I think casual integration can be wayyyy more powerful than making it a narrative focus.
