He has written many songs, such as "Pancho and Lefty", "For the Sake of the Song", "Tecumseh Valley", "Rex's Blues" and "To Live Is to Fly", which are widely regarded as masterpiece of American Text. His music style is often described as melancholy and poetic. During his early years, Van Zandt was respected for his guitar playing and fingering techniques. In 1983, six years after Emmylou Harris first popularized it, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard covered their song "Pancho and Lefty", reaching number one on the Billboard country music charts. Much of Van Zandt's life was spent visiting the various dive bars, often living in cheap hostel rooms and log cabins. For most of the 1970s, he lived in a simple cabin with no electricity or telephone.</p><table class=wikibox readability=14.5><tr><td class=wk_label>Birth name</td><td class=wk_value>John Townes Van Zandt</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>March 7, 1944, Fort Worth, Texas, US</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>January 1, 1997, Smyrna, Tennessee, US</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Genres</td><td class=wk_value>Country, folk, blues</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Occupation(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Musician, singer-songwriter, producer, arranger</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Instruments</td><td class=wk_value>Guitar, vocals</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1965–1996</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Labels</td><td class=wk_value>Poppy, Tomato, Sugar Hill, TVZ, Fat Possum</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Associated acts</td><td class=wk_value>Blaze Foley, Guy Clark, Steve Earle, Lightnin' Hopkins, Mickey Newbury</td></tr></table><p>Country Singer Townes Van Zandt was born in Fort Worth, Texas, United States on March 7, 1944.
