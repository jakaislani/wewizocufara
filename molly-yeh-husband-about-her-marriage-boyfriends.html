Since hosting the popular show, the Illinois native has become one of the most talked-about celebrity chefs in the country.</strong></p><p>Aside from her exceptional professional life, Molly enjoys a wonderful relationship with her husband. Unlike Yeh, who has become relatively famous, her husband, Nick Hagen, is a Grand Forks farmer. She also resides on her husband’s family farm near North Dakota City.</p><p>We’re sure many of you are intrigued about how they met and fell in love. When did they get married? Do they have any children together? Without further ado, let’s get all the answers right now!</p><h2><span id=Molly_Yeh_and_Nick_Hagen_are_living_the_good_life>Molly Yeh and Nick Hagen are living the good life.</span></h2><p>Molly Hagen married Nick Hagen in December 2014. They were together for several years before deciding to settle down for real. The couple is currently residing on Hagen’s family farm near Grand Forks, North Dakota. Molly’s mother, Jody Yeh, also lives nearby.</p><p>Molly spends her time at the farm playing in the kitchen and with her chickens, whom she has named. She usually names her chicks after masculine pen names of famous female authors. For example, George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans) and Charlotte Bronte’s Curer Bell.</p><p>She creates a variety of dishes for her husband and family, as she is an enthusiastic cook. She generally cooks with ingredients that are grown on their farm.</p><p>Molly’s life has undoubtedly changed for the better as a result of her time on the farm. She authored a cookbook, landed a Food Network show, and, best of all, became a mother since relocating to Great Fork with her fiancé became life partner. To say she lives a high farm life would be an understatement.</p><h2><span id=What_prompted_Molly_to_relocate_to_a_farm>What prompted Molly to relocate to a farm?</span></h2><p>When we initially learned about Molly’s personal life, one item piqued our interest. What prompted Molly to relocate from Brooklyn to the little town of Grand Forks? Her husband Nick, on the other hand, was the one who persuaded Yeh to relocate to his family’s property.</p><p>Molly said in her book, Molly on the Range, that she and her husband, while residing in New York, were ‘fierce inner homebodies.’ When they lived in New York, the couple spent their weekends inside or sometimes playing catch, which is quite different from what a typical New Yorker does.</p><p>Molly faced a quandary after graduating from Juilliard with a degree in percussion. To continue playing in the orchestra or to abandon everything to pursue her passion for cooking. Yeh realized her genuine interest after starting a cuisine blog in 2009.</p><p>Fortunately, her boyfriend Nick was very supportive of her decision and encouraged her to pursue her passion for cooking. He even invited her to live with him on his family’s farm. She told Glamour about her desire to relocate,</p><p>“When Nick mentioned going to the farm, I thought, Oh my word. I could spend all of my time blogging. And it was at that point that I realized it could actually happen.”</p><p>And, as they say, the rest is history!</p><h2><span id=Molly_and_Nick_welcomed_their_first_child_in_2019>Molly and Nick welcomed their first child in 2019.</span></h2><p>Molly became a mother for the first time on March 30, 2019. She gave birth to a lovely girl. Bernadette Rosemary Yeh Hagen, who weighed 7 pounds and 6 ounces at birth, was named by the couple.</p><p>We’ll naturally wonder what your child’s first solid meal will be if you become famous for anything relating to food, won’t we? When asked the same question by USA Today, Yeh responded,</p><p>“I wanted it to be something sweet, not a vegetable.” “However, for the sake of convenience, I’m not opposed to jarred baby food if the ingredients are good.” I’ll make a lot of her food, but I won’t be neurotic about it.”</p><p>To be honest, Baby Bernie is quite fortunate! Her mother will prepare all of the world’s delicacies.</p><p>Besides, Molly frequently posts photos of her daughter on social media, and we could all use a little more Bernie in our lives. Her gorgeous daughter brings out the best in everyone.</p><h2><span id=In_2022_they_became_parents_for_the_second_time>In 2022, they became parents for the second time.</span></h2><p>The couple welcomed their second daughter on February 20, 2022, just a few years after welcoming their first. Dorothy Yeh Hagen was the name they gave to their second child. She weighed 8 pounds, 12 ounces, and was 21.5 inches long when she was born.</p><p>She announced the huge news on social media, writing,</p><p>Furthermore, mommy stated for the second time that her daughter resembles her older sister Bernie.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_backstory_of_Molly_and_Nick8217s_passionate_love_tale_by_the_way>What is the backstory of Molly and Nick’s passionate love tale, by the way?</span></h2><p>Their relationship began in the most ordinary of ways. The pair were former college classmates who reconnected a few years after graduating. Nick played trombone in the college orchestra. After finishing college, he returned to his home state of North Dakota to work on his family’s farm.</p><p>Yeh cites Hagen as a sincere, honest, and grounded person in her book, Molly on the Range, describing him as “an 80-year-old man in a 20-something man’s body.”</p><p>Molly was fresh out of a relationship when she reconnected with Hagen. She had apparently swore herself off the boys. Nick had once attended a Sunday night quartet party with Molly’s best buddy. Molly, ironically, set up Nick on a date with a writer friend of hers at the party.</p><p>Nonetheless, Molly’s friend and Nick’s relationship did not work out. Nick eventually invited her out on a bike ride date, and they quickly fell in love.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/what-does-katie-george-an-espn-sportscaster-get-paid/"}{"1":65}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>American author</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Victor Davis Hanson</a></h3>Victor Davis Hanson- Biography Victor Davis Hanson is a well-known American figure in the fields of journalism, history, education, and politics.
