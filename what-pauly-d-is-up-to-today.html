That's why fans of the Jersey Shore star were left scratching their heads when Pauly was spotted getting close with someone who couldn't possibly be more different than him: Chloë Sevigny. The world's most unlikely pairing came to us by way of the duo accidentally getting seated next to one another <a href=#>courtside at a Knicks game</a>.</p><p>Before anyone could get too excited that the DJ was dating New York's <a href=#>forever cool girl</a>, the indie-film darling squashed the goss in an interview with <a href=#>Interview</a> magazine. "No, but I wish, because that would be hilarious," she said, adding, "That would be the weirdest couple in the world. It would be like the apocalypse. We represent extremes, in opposite directions." Ouch, sorry, Pauly!&nbsp;</p><p>The celeb doesn't have to get his hopes up just yet, however, as Sevigny finds him "funny and easygoing." When asked if she's ever watched the show, the starlet quipped, "I haven't watched that many episodes ... if I were to pick one of the dudes on the show, I'd definitely pick him." You go, girl.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam1nZ353e9ahmK1loJbCrcWMnWSiq12qvW7AzmarqJyRrnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
