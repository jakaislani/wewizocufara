She has two older siblings: a brother, Morgan, and a sister, Alison.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Carey’s parents divorced when she was 3 years old. She stunned her mother by imitating her operatic singing as early as age 2, and was given singing lessons starting at age 4. Eventually, Carey developed a voice that spanned five octaves. Few singers have achieved this vocal feat; David Lee Roth and Yma Sumac are among the handful of others to have done so.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduating in 1987 from Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, Carey moved to Manhattan where she worked as a waitress and a coat check girl and studied cosmetology, while writing songs and actively pursuing a music career at night.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 title="Early Music Career: Mariah Carey and Emotions Albums" data-anchor-id=early-music-career-mariah-carey-and-emotions-albums class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Music Career: Mariah Carey and Emotions Albums</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When she was 18 years old, Carey and her friend, singer Brenda K. Starr, went to a party hosted by CBS Records. Starr convinced Carey to bring along one of her demo tapes. She intended to give the tape to Columbia’s Jerry Greenberg, but Tommy Mottola, the president of Columbia Records (later Sony), intercepted it before she could hand it to Greenberg. After listening to the tape on the way home from the party, Mottola signed Carey immediately and set her to work on her first album, Mariah Carey (1990), which included four No. 1 singles: “Vision of Love,” “Love Takes Time,” “Some Day,” and “I Don’t Wanna Cry.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her second album, Emotions, was released in 1992; the title track became her fifth No. 1 single, and included the hits “Can’t Let Go” and “Make it Happen.”</p><h2 data-node-id=15 title="Music Box, Daydream, and Butterfly" data-anchor-id=music-box-daydream-and-butterfly class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Music Box, Daydream, and Butterfly</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In March 1992, Carey appeared on MTV’s Unplugged.

In 1995 she released Daydream; its first single, “Fantasy,” debuted at No. 1. It also included collaborations with R&B and hip-hop artists such as Wu-Tang Clan and Boyz II Men (“One Sweet Day”).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her 1997 album, Butterfly, included 11 compositions written by Carey, and demonstrated her continued interest in hip-hop and R&B, including the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/sean-puffy-combs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sean “Puffy” Combs" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sean “Puffy” Combs</a>-produced “Honey,” her 12th No. 1 hit.
