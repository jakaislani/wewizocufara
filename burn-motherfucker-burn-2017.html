The freeway system encouraged the mobility of all LA residents, but the LAPD—supported by the Los Angeles power-structure—was invested in keeping the black neighborhoods isolated, cut off. This is a huge and complex topic in and of itself, and deserves more in-depth exploration than occurs here, but Jenkins has used his diverse group of interview subjects (historians, activists, lawyers, Watts residents) as witnesses and expert guides, who lay it out for us beautifully well. People like Connie Rice, Danny Bakewell, Aqeela Sherrills, Mike Davis, Congresswoman <a href=#>Karen Bass</a>, and more provide texture, context, and personal memories to the well-known historical events Jenkins covers.</p><p>The 1965 Watts uprising ("It wasn't a riot," says Bakewell, "It was a rebellion against oppression") was one of many across the country in the second half of the 1960s, when city after city exploded in violence. Something like Watts in 1965 does not come out of nowhere. After the April 1962 gunfight at the Nation of Islam Mosque in Los Angeles, where black men were shot by cops through the genitals (among other atrocities), Malcolm X gave a speech, saying, "If he's not ready to clean his house up, he shouldn't have a house. It should catch on fire and burn down." The footage of the Watts uprising, though familiar, is terrifying, and told through multiple viewpoints, those who lived in Watts, those who worked the cop beat that day. There's footage of the National Guard rolling into town, and signs put up at the end of streets that warned motorists: "Turn left or get shot." Store owners spray-painted messages to looters on their storefronts, one being: "Negro Owned. Brother let me live."</p><p>William Parker, the notorious police chief of the LAPD from 1950 until his death in 1966, the man responsible for militarizing the police force, plays a major role in all of this, for obvious reasons, but also because his protege—Darryl Gates—was police chief at the time of the Rodney King beating. Gates stepped down in the wake of the uproar following the acquittal of the LAPD officers involved in King's beating. But Gates' reign could be seen as a continuation of Parker's reign, with the same implicit and explicit racism, the same deadly use of force. One of the interview subjects makes the point that after Gates stepped down, the LAPD named Willie Williams as the next police chief, who had been the police chief in Philadelphia. The system was so corrupt and Parker-ized that they couldn't even recruit from "their own."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46brKumXaK8tbTEq52um5uav26u1KulZmpgZoQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
