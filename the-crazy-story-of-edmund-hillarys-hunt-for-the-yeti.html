The expedition stretched from September 1960 through June 1961. Members of the expedition assembled in the so-called "<a href=#>yeti stronghold</a>" of the Rolwaling Valley near Kathmandu. A remote location, it runs along the frontier between Nepal and Tibet (via <a href=#>One World Trekking</a>), and it's got all the vibes you'd expect from a supposed abominable snowman hangout: isolation, snow, and rugged, ice-clad mountains.</p><p>The Sherpa refer to the Rolwaling Valley as "the grave," which had to give expedition members a warm, fuzzy feeling. To this day, the Rolwaling Valley trek remains one of the most challenging mountaineering experiences in Nepal, as reported by <a href=#>Mountain IQ</a>. Why did the Silver Hut expedition settle on this location? Because it's where Eric Shipton captured his yeti footprints in 1951.</p><p>What else did the Silver Hut expedition know about the footprints?&nbsp;In his case report (via <a href=#>Science Direct</a>), Dr. Michael Ward described two sets of tracks, one indistinct and the other more precise, which Shipton's expedition followed down a glacier. In the aftermath of the find, Ward noted, "There have been innumerable descriptions of unusual footprints found in the snows of the Himalaya and elsewhere; and bear tracks and bears have been seen, sometimes attacking Tibetan shepherds and yaks." Had the tracks been made by bears?&nbsp;The expedition dug in to find answers.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAlW1tcHFfqbWmecKrmLOxXajBsL7YZqafZZWZura6w2afoqSclr%2B6v4yhrKesXZu8s3nToZxmsZWptnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
