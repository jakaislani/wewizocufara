Needless to say, a sequel series would take some doing, what with how certain irrevocable situations would have to have turned out fine after all, and you’d need to bring various characters from the dead.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Plus, the series has already continued on. In 2019, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">El Camino</a> </strong>gave viewers one more hit of Jesse Pinkman, and Better Call Saul managed the impossible by sticking the landing during its series finale despite being a prequel, even offering a few looks into the shared universe’s future.</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>But Heisenberg’s journey is pretty definitively at an end, from from a Joseph Campbell monomythic perspective, and a physiological one. Even Vince Gilligan and Bryan Cranston would have a hard time pulling compelling plot points out of the adventures of Albuquerque’s most entrepreneurial machine gun victim, short of a Walking Dead crossover, or the eleventh-hour intervention of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">OCP’s cyborg program</a>.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>Still, it doesn’t cost anything to dream, even if it does cost a decent amount to license Adobe Premiere, and fans of the series have been putting together concept trailers for a Breaking Bad return pretty much since the minute that the series properly ended.</p><h2 id=h-where-did-the-breaking-bad-2-trailer-come-from data-injectable=false>Where did the Breaking Bad 2 trailer come from?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=740 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>Recently, the folks over at the Chubs YouTube channel made a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">super compelling fan video</a> advertising a purported follow-up — one wherein Hank explodes up out of his shallow grave like the ghost of Kojak, and where Walter White sure looks a lot like Bryan Cranston’s character from the Showtime series Your Honor. The video became the channel’s most successful offering by a wide stretch, racking up more than seven million views. Meanwhile, another Chubs concept trailer for Better Call Saul 2 was left in the lurch, receiving just shy of a million clicks. It’s not hard to see why the Breaking Bad video is so successful — the creators made something genuinely special, occasionally convincing, and entirely entertaining.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>What they didn’t do was make Breaking Bad 2. Because nobody did. Because it’s not happening. Sorry.
