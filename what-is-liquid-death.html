It feels like a lame joke from a time travel movie in which someone from the ‘80s is transported to the present day and goes to the faucet to get a drink of water while everyone else looks at them like they’re bonkers while holding their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">canned water</a>. But it makes sense. Our ground water got dirty or we learned more about what’s coming from the tap, so people started drinking from plastic bottles. Now we know that the plastic isn’t really recyclable so we’ve moved onto cans. But while millennials latched onto <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LaCroix flavors</a>, Gen Z has set their sights on Liquid Death. But what is Liquid Death? Who owns Liquid Death? Is liquid death just water? Is Liquid Death alcoholic? Does Liquid Death have caffeine? Can kids drink Liquid Death? Let’s dive into the deep end and find out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-liquid-death><strong>What is Liquid Death?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Liquid Death is a canned water company that began selling its products in 2019. The brand is steeped in ironic “Heavy Metal” imagery reminiscent of early aughts stalwart Ed Hardy. Liquid Death comes in “tall boy” cans emblazoned with a melting skull that wouldn’t look out of place at a bar, party, rave, or festival. By marketing plain old water in such an aggressive, extreme manner, complete with tagline “murder your thirst,” Liquid Death managed to become one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most followed beverage brands on TikTok</a>. The brand is popular. The marketing is funny. People really like it, especially young people. So of course it’s getting a ton of attention.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-owns-liquid-death><strong>Who owns Liquid Death?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mike Cessario</a>, the public face of Liquid Death, is the co-founder and CEO. He, along with J.R. Riggins, bartender Pat Cook, and artist Will Carsola, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">founded the company.</a> The story goes that Cessario was at a Vans Warped Tour where he spoke with some bands that said they’d rather be drinking water on stage than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">energy drinks</a>. So he got the idea to sell water but market it as if it was Monster. As a graphic designer and former Netflix creative director, Cessario was the perfect person for the job.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/RANKING_CANNED-WATER_HEADER-1170x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-best-canned-water><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Canned Water</a></h2><p>What’s the best canned water? Is it Liquid Death? We tasted a bunch of the top brands on the market to find the best canned water to quench your thirst.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-liquid-death-just-water><strong>Is Liquid Death just water?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>If you buy one of Liquid Death’s canned waters, then yes, Liquid Death is just plain old water. Now there are other beverages available from Liquid Death, but nothing too crazy. Mostly water, iced tea, and sparkling water in a few flavors.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-liquid-death-alcoholic><strong>Is liquid death alcoholic?</strong></h2><p>There is no alcohol in Liquid Death. Even though Liquid Death may look like a beer in a tall boy can, it is not alcoholic. It comes in those cans because aluminum is more sustainable than plastic, it makes the water feel and taste colder, and because it looks cool.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-liquid-death-have-caffeine><strong>Does liquid death have caffeine?</strong></h2><p>Liquid Death water and sparkling water do not have caffeine either. Liquid Death has released a few teas that have a little caffeine in them, but no more than is usual for iced tea—about 30 mg.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-can-kids-drink-liquid-death><strong>So, can kids drink Liquid Death?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Sure! But they have to be a pretty cool kid. Otherwise it may look weird. If I saw a nerd kid with a Liquid Death can, I’d probably take it away from them. And then I’d drink it. I just really like Liquid Death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmo6KppZ6xbrDEmquhZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
