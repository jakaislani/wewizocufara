Are you adding a handful of blueberries or white granulated sugar, or nothing at all, and wondering why your mornings are so boring? Do you want to revamp your hot cereal game? Well, look no further because this list of oatmeal toppings has everything from unassuming to unhinged and we are sure you will find at least one outrageous topping on this list that piques your interest. So, take a look see and hopefully one of these options will float your oats!</p><strong>Brown Sugar and Cinnamon</strong><p>This is the classic for a reason. It is sweet, molasses-y, aromatic, deep, dark, rich, and comforting. This combo will never not be a winner. Plus, if I ever acquire twin kittens these will be their names (and don’t you worry, I’ll call Brown Sugar “B. Shug” for short—it will be adorable).</p><p>Ah yes, brown sugar’s Canadian and Vermontian cousin, although this particular <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pancake syrup</a> has nothing to do with New England or Canada. No, Pearl Milling Company’s syrup is not from a tree, but it warmed our hearts with its quintessential breakfasty smell and taste. Sporked senior writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick </a>noted how it “smelled like breakfast the moment you opened the bottle. The flavor is buttery and sweet and a little salty. The level of maple was powerful without being overwhelming.” If you are a maple fiend and are looking for a new vehicle for your maple-y goodness, try this stuff out as an oatmeal topping and love your life.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Pancake Syrup: Douse the Most Important Meal of the Day in These 7 Syrups</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Trader Jacques’ Fleur de Sel Caramel Sauce</strong></a><p>I know, sacrilege. But I ask you this, oh reader person, how different is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">caramel sauce</a> from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">maple syrup</a>? Like, actually. The answer is pretty darn not different. So, if you like a roasty, toasty caramel flavor profile, add this to your rotating list of oatmeal toppings. You could even throw some apples in there for a caramel apple vibe, or some bananas for a Bananas Foster vibe, or even some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fudge sauce</a> for a Sunday Morning Morning Sundae (patent pending) vibe.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Caramel Sauce for Coffee, Ice Cream, and Eating Straight Off the Spoon</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Häagen-Dazs Vanilla Bean Ice Cream</strong></a><p>Speaking of Sunday Morning Morning Sundaes, it’s always after dinner somewhere, baybee! Which means we should be putting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vanilla ice cream</a> on our mental list of “what to top oatmeal with.” I know it’s untraditional but hear me out: It’s like waffles and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">whipped cream</a>, but the porridge version. Plus, you can use, as Jordan put it, “the most perfect and most delicious vanilla ice cream you can imagine,” add some berries, and take your oatmeal topping game to the next level. Is this really any more dessert-y than a crumb coffee cake, a chocolate muffin, or an almond croissant? I ask you this. Plus, I think this would make a delectable late-night <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">study snack</a>.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Vanilla Ice Cream: Go Ahead, Be Vanilla</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crumbled-up Christie Cookie Co.

No really, good jam is actually so insanely flavorful, tart, sweet, and fruity as all get out. That being said, mixing jam into your oatmeal is like mixing fruity syrup into your oatmeal. That is to say, it is a great oatmeal topping and you should do it. And this strawberry jam tastes like heaven in a jar. “This jam just feels like it was made from fresh strawberries,” one taste tester said. That’s a hard thing for a supermarket jam to achieve.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Are You Jelly?

With the popularity of things like overnight oats <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and parfaits</a>, you probably know by now that yogurt and oatmeal go together quite deliciously. Plus, if you use this lemon meringue yogurt from Oikos, you get “the tartness of the lemon and the natural tartness of the rich, decadent yogurt,” as well as the “the creamy meringue flavor they managed to cram into this little cup.” In other words, you can use this to make a super creamy lemon meringue pie-flavored oatmeal, and that is pretty darn awesome.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Flavored Greek Yogurt: The 9 Best Greek Yogurt Flavors, from Apple to Berry</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuwM6pp6Kml6h6p7vRZqaarJ2arq17</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
