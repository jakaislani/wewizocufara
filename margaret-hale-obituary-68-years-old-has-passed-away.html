She was 68 years old, and her departure leaves a void that can never be filled. Margaret was a precious and devoted wife to John, a treasured and cherished mother to Louise, Catherine, and Jacqueline, a caring and adored grandmother to Jessica, Lucy, Aubree, Carys, and Eva, and a much-loved mother-in-law to Chris and Thomas.</p><p>Her memory will be forever etched in the hearts of her family and friends.Margaret was a woman of immense warmth and kindness, and her presence brought joy and comfort to those around her. Her dedication to her family was unwavering, and her role as a wife, mother, grandmother, and mother-in-law was carried out with grace and love. Her legacy lives on through the countless lives she touched and the love she shared.</p><p>To honor Margaret’s memory and her enduring spirit, a service and cremation will be held on Friday, November 10th, at 2:00 pm in the Blackley Crematorium center chapel. This will be a time for family and friends to come together, sharing their memories and finding solace in their shared grief. In lieu of sending flowers, the family kindly requests that donations be made to “The Macmillan Care team.” This choice reflects Margaret’s compassionate nature and her commitment to helping others in their time of need. Your contributions will make a meaningful difference in the lives of those battling illness and seeking care.</p><p>For any additional information or inquiries regarding the service, please reach out to Michael Kennedy personally at Greater Manchester Funeral Service in Moston. He can be reached at 0161 681 1864 and will provide guidance and support during this difficult time. Margaret’s memory will forever be a source of love, strength, and inspiration to all who had the privilege of knowing her. As we gather to say our final goodbyes, let us also celebrate the life she lived and the love she shared. Margaret may be gone, but her legacy of kindness and love will continue to shine brightly in the hearts of those she touched.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwucCrnpqqlal6qa3LnmSompmpwqK%2B2GZtcWWpmq6zv4yoo51lmJbAbrzArKqenF2WxKLFjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
