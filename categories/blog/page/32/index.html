<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2024-08-27>August 27, 2024</time></span></div><section class=summary>At that start of his career, UnoTheActivist frequently collaborated with fellow Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti on tracks like “What,” “Whole Thang” and “Vlone Thug.” It made sense for the two to collaborate as much as they did since they grew up together and were in a rap group called TFZ in high school. Unfortunately, things between them soured after Uno was shot in 2016.
A couple of years after the shooting, Uno took to Twitter to randomly voice his opinion on Carti and brought to light the issues he had with him. <a href=../../../../title-unotheactivist-puts-his-beef-with-playboi-carti-to-rest-says-theyre-not-cousins.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../intel-releases-advisory-update-x299-for-cascadex-and-lose-kabyx-support.html>Update X299 for Cascade-X, and Lose Kaby-X Support</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

With luck, some processor variants can share entries, but ultimately the more processors a platform supports, the larger the BIOS firmware tends to be. As we have moved from basic BIOS implementations to complex UEFI interfaces, the amount of free space inside BIOS firmware has reduced drastically. <a href=../../../../intel-releases-advisory-update-x299-for-cascadex-and-lose-kabyx-support.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../what-are-the-lyrics-to-newjeans-new-song-asap.html>What are the lyrics to NewJeans new song ASAP?</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

Although they only made their debut last year, the five-member girl group is already one of the most popular K-pop groups worldwide. Armed with five new songs, it seems like NewJeans is only growing in popularity with no signs of slowing down. Recommended Videos While some fans are unhappy with Get Up‘s short length — the five-song EP comes out to a little over 12 minutes — it’s hard to deny the foot-tapping quality of NewJeans’ music. <a href=../../../../what-are-the-lyrics-to-newjeans-new-song-asap.html>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../../../categories/blog/page/31/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>
