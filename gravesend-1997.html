I am reminded of movies such as “<a href=#>New Jersey Drive</a>,” “<a href=#>Straight Out of Brooklyn</a>,” “<a href=#>Spike of Bensonhurst</a>” and “<a href=#>True Love</a>.” But the lives of these four friends are lived at a monotonous level; they lack the words and perhaps the concepts for pastimes more challenging than drinking, smoking dope, holding aimless arguments and getting into meaningless fights. Even this material could be made amusing, but not here, where the characters seem to circle in loops of their own devising.</p><p>And yet there are good things to be said about “Gravesend,” and the most astonishing is that it was made for a reported $5,000, which is $3,000 less than <a href=#>Robert Rodriguez</a> spent on “<a href=#>El Mariachi</a>,” the previous yardstick for inexpensive independent films. Stabile made the film when he was 19, found backers to put up post-production cash, and impressed so many people with his raw talent that “Gravesend” is “An <a href=#>Oliver Stone</a> Presentation” and the director, now 22, has two projects under contract with <a href=#>Steven Spielberg</a></p><p>Stabile probably has good films in him. “Gravesend,” made with limited resources, shows that. It also gives hints of the ways he’ll be able to find humor in tough characters. The most entertaining performance in the movie is by Macky Aquilino as JoJo the junkie, a janitor and drug dealer whom the four friends ask for a favor: They need to dispose of a body. His price, after negotiation: “$500 and a thumb.” Cars with bodies in their trunks tend to attract trouble in the movies, and Stabile has fun with a tow truck operator and a cop, who both want to get their hands on the car. He also writes in a lot of unsuccessful Tarantino-esque dialogue, including arguments about math problems and lottery odds, and whether <a href=#>Walter Cronkite</a> or Hugh Downs is the host of “20/20.” There are flashes of life here, a feeling of immediacy in the camera style, a lot of energy--and promise. But it’s not yet the movie he’s probably capable of; I have a feeling anyone with the wit to make a movie for $5,000 can write characters more worth knowing than these</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46gqZqulaiyr7CManBybw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
