He comes with his side men to pound some questions into Faison, who finally leads them to the correct apartment, where they find a gang of lousy bank robbers (<a href=#>Mike Epps</a>, <a href=#>Wood Harris</a>, <a href=#>Omari Hardwick</a>) who got the shipment, and three men who plan to buy the drugs from them.</p><p>This puts, I dunno, nine or 10 heavily armed men in a room of limited size. One reason the cops don't respond to the eventual gunfire is that the room simply couldn't&nbsp;<span>hold them. Since a shotgun and an automatic rifle are included with the handguns and one of those gourmet carving knife sets, I'm not sure why the MPAA's R rating mentions "some violence." In the MPA's coded terminology, the word "some" means "violence, but nothing to get too worked up about." I guess that's fair; there are none of those 3-D X-ray shots showing a bullet inching its way in slow motion through human organ meats.</span></p><p>A plot this complex, with so many characters to keep alive, could easily go astray. Indeed, I could make no sense of this week's "<a href=#>The Perfect Sleep</a>" despite a fulsome narration. But this film's director, <a href=#>Benny Boom</a>, a music video director, knows what he's doing and skillfully intercuts the story strands. The first-time screenplay by <a href=#>Blair Cobbs</a> has a lot of dire dialogue, very sunny, and presents the world's most inept bank robbers along with its most inept delivery man and most imprudent drug lord.</p><p>Nice surprise: <a href=#>Debbie Allen</a> plays the manager of the delivery company and gets a big laugh; no, not just because the audience sees she's Debbie Allen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46nnLGsXZmuunnAoqlmamBlhg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
