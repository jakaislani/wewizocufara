Particularly in the early 2000s, it seemed that all one needed to successfully launch a new series was a flashy setting (either over-complicated or under-explored), a photogenic cast and some procedural hook, usually one past its expiration date by the end of the first season.</p><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>Lately, though, audiences have demanded more. This millennium’s most well-regarded sci-fi programs, like&nbsp;Firefly and <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, are so universally praised because they went above and beyond what was required of them, proving undaunted&nbsp;by ambitious, tricky narratives. And viewers&nbsp;are currently gifted&nbsp;with some terrific series (e.g. Orphan Black,&nbsp;Black Mirror)&nbsp;that have followed in their footsteps, tackling heady questions of human ethics head-on.</p><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>Despite following a trio of bounty hunters operating in the wild west of deep space (let that breath out, Whedonites, it’s not worth it), Syfy’s&nbsp;<strong>Killjoys</strong> is not one of those upper-spectrum shows. It doesn’t even want to be. Instead, the series seems more like a premiere from the early 2000s, checking all the boxes for a compact, low-cost, generically sound sci-fi. Coming as it does, just as Syfy says it’s pushing forward with higher-concept shows in hopes of returning the network’s&nbsp;Battlestar halcyon days, is an undeniable disappointment.</p><p data-characters=688 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>But unlike the recently premiered&nbsp;Dark Matter, one would be ill-advised to immediately haul&nbsp;Killjoys&nbsp;on the scrap heap and deem it another out-and-out failure.&nbsp;After all, sci-fi – like fantasy –&nbsp;is beloved for its ability to transport viewers to another world, to situate them among a crazy cast of characters and spin fantastical yarns about furious firefights (lasers, not bullets, naturally) carried out by&nbsp;devil-may-care heroes. And, in that manner,&nbsp;Killjoys is a pleasant-enough&nbsp;diversion, keeping the quips flying and the tone feather-light.&nbsp;It’s not bad, per se – it’s just a fun time-killer at a time when&nbsp;audiences may be looking for more.</p><p data-characters=653 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=false>The aforementioned trio is comprised of impossible badass Dutch (Hannah John-Kamen, a refreshingly multicultural lead); tech whiz John (Aaron Ashmore, jumping over from Syfy’s&nbsp;Warehouse 13); and D’avin (Luke MacFarlane), an ex-soldier and John’s estranged brother. As those descriptions would suggest, all three are staple characters for a sci-fi series like this, but the pleasant surprise here is that the actors actually do a pretty admirable job of making them likable despite their sometimes irksome familiarity. John-Kamen is a particular standout, selling her badass-chick-with-a-hidden-past lead with&nbsp;charisma and conviction.</p><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><h5 class=review-rating>Fair</h5><p class=review-summary>Killjoy is a zippy, high-octane, low-intelligence way to kill an hour between episodes of denser, deeper shows without feeling like you've been short-changed.</p><p class=review-title>Killjoys Season 1 Review</p>Pages: <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>1</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>2</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ystculoaixo2LApq3SqKVmaV2nsre1xLBm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
