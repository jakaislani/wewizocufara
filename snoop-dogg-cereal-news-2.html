Welp, we have good news and bad news. We’ll give you the bad news first, since that’s what most normal people want: It’s no longer called Snoop Loopz, despite the obvious cultural significance of the phrase <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“snoop-a-loop.”</a> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Snoop</a> (via Instagram), a cereal “Goliath” stepped in and prevented them from using the name. Boo. Now the good news: The cereal is heading to grocery stores on July 15 under a new moniker, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snoop Cereal</a>. Not as catchy, but it’ll have to do.</p><p>Snoop’s Broadus Foods partnered with Post Consumer Brands (maker of cereals such as Honeycomb, Oreo O’s, and Fruity Pebbles) on three varieties: Fruity Hoopz with Marshmallows, Cinnamon Toasteez, and Frosted Drizzlerz. And this venture isn’t solely profit-driven. According to Post’s press release, “Broadus Foods donates a portion of the proceeds from each sale to charities that tackle homelessness and food insecurity, such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Door of Hope</a>.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-what-can-we-expect-from-the-new-snoop-cereal-is-there-truly-no-limit-to-snoop-and-master-p-s-foray-into-breakfast-territory>So, what can we expect from the new Snoop Cereal? Is there truly No Limit to Snoop and Master P’s foray into breakfast territory?</h2><p>According to Post, Fruity Hoopz is “a sweetened multigrain cereal featuring fun vibrant colors packed with a punch of undeniable fruity deliciousness,” while Cinnamon Toasteez is “a tasty, sweetened crispy wheat and rice cereal with just the right hint of cinnamon.” As for Frosted Drizzlers? That’s a “sweetened, crunchy, frosted whole grain wheat cereal” that’s also eligible for the USDA’s WIC program (aka the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AGGREGATED-RANKING_CEREAL_HEADER-1170x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-all-the-best-cereal-we-ve-tried-in-our-taste-tests><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All the Best Cereal We’ve Tried in Our Taste Tests</a></h2><p>Cereal is a breakfast staple—but the best cereal will tempt you all day long. (Breakfast-for-dessert, ftw.)&nbsp;These are the best cereals we’ve tried in our taste tests…so far.</p><p>Accessibility is big part of the brand’s mission. As Percy “Master P” Miller said in a press release, “Our motto is the more we make the more we give. I grew up on WIC, and I am honored and humbled to now own a company with Snoop that can service underprivileged families.” For his part, Snoop (aka Calvin Broadus, hence Broadus Foods) has already declared himself and Master P “the new Kings of Breakfast Food.” All hail the kings. We can’t wait to eat Snoop Cereal while celebrating the <a href=# rel=noopener>50th anniversary of hip-hop</a> and listening to “Gin and Juice” and “Bout It, Bout It” on repeat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKuepLyxecOonqBlk5q%2Fpq3LZqWer6Nif3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
