It started terribly with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, our summer was ruined by the dreadful Secret Invasion, and we capped things off with The Marvels <a href=#>flopping so hard it broke records</a>. Sure, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was good, but even that brief joy was tempered by knowing it was James Gunn’s MCU swansong.</p><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>But despite all this misery, with only a few days left of the calendar year, this very odd video may have lowered the tone even further.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>Marvel fans are currently collectively furrowing their brow at one of the most surreal MCU fan videos we’ve ever seen, in which TikTok and YouTube star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Annie Dvorak</a> has imagined the major MCU characters reacting to discovering a fan was hurting themselves. You’ve gotta see this to believe it:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true><a title=@anniedvorak href=#>@anniedvorak</a><p>Replying to @user4717145918249 I was avoiding this, because I like to keep things light and fun. Then from reading your comments I realized It might help someone who struggles with this. Please watch till the end. And stay safe. Life is beautiful! I love you. <a title=fypシ href=#>#fypシ</a> <a title=marvel href=#>#marvel</a> <a title=marvelreactions href=#>#marvelreactions</a> <a title=mentalhealthmatters href=#>#mentalhealthmatters</a></p><a title="♬ Je te laisserai des mots - 𝐼𝑡’𝑠 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑎 𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑚" href=#>♬ Je te laisserai des mots – 𝐼𝑡’𝑠 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑎 𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑚</a></figure><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>There’s a lot to unpack here. First up you may be wondering: is this a joke? Well Dvorak herself says that she’d avoided making the video as she prefers to “keep things light and fun”, but realized seeing the MCU’s heroes like this “might help someone who struggles”. At the end of the video, she breaks character to underline that this video is for “entertainment purposes only” and provides a support number for anyone in danger of committing self-harm.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>Reactions have been all over the board. The TikTok comments indicate that for many viewers this was a genuinely life-affirming and emotional experience: “As someone who’s been clean for a month, this is actually really comforting”, “this healed something in me I was missing”, and “thank you for your video and your empathy”.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>But the video has also been reposted on X where the response is a little more direct: “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Free speech was a mistake</a>“, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this is the weirdest and most offputting thing I’ve seen</a>, and the succinct “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">might be the worst video of all time.</a>“</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>All that said, even the haters can’t deny that Dvorak nailed these characters. Her Natasha, Wanda, and Peter are all top-tier, though for us it’s her scarily intense Loki that hits the highest note. Criticize the concept, but you can’t deny the talent:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>it’s emotional, it has dramatic lighting, it’s a work of art and i say this with complete seriousness</p>— clem “bitchin’ camaro” (@nicotineliker) <a href=#>December 17, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=36 data-current-count=36 data-injectable=false>This is the nexus of cringe/amazing:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>was literally going to comment the exact same thing</p>— ella (@illgrowuptmrw) <a href=#>December 19, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=28 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>Would we go this far?
